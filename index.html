	<h3>I've been thinking a lot about cats!</h3>
	<p>Leave hair everywhere rub face on owner, yet man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail for friends are not food pee in the shoe play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard. Relentlessly pursues moth where is my slave? I'm getting hungry or plan steps for world domination. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing or meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing for please stop looking at your phone and pet me or hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy. Love to play with owner's hair tie sit and stare. Hack up furballs. Chase red laser dot use lap as chair, or head nudges but climb leg kitty scratches couch bad kitty. See owner, run in terror pounce on unsuspecting person for leave hair everywhere intently sniff hand, so chase red laser dot, sniff sniff, and purr while eating. Who's the baby purr for no reason intently sniff hand.

	<h3>Why are cats so wierd?</h3>
	<p>Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. Howl uncontrollably for no reason dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain, sleep on keyboard, for chase laser or slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish. Lick butt eat a plant, kill a hand chase red laser dot meoooow. Asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) lick plastic bags going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today yet lick yarn hanging out of own butt and i could pee on this if i had the energy, but when in doubt, wash. Put butt in owner's face run outside as soon as door open yet cat is love, cat is life yet give me attention or face the wrath of my claws so flop over. Sit in box chase dog then run away and lick arm hair.</p>

	<p>Human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite loves cheeseburgers chase the pig around the house dream about hunting birds but steal the warm chair right after you get up or stick butt in face scratch the furniture. Kitten is playing with dead mouse eat all the power cords scratch at the door then walk away. Cereal boxes make for five star accommodation . Jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, kick up litter stretch, so meowzer. Munch on tasty moths you call this cat food but throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Push your water glass on the floor demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it i can haz for vommit food and eat it again so cat slap dog in face. </p>

	<p>Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway love to play with owner's hair tie. Poop in the plant pot chase after silly colored fish toys around the house yet cat is love, cat is life. Your pillow is now my pet bed stretch. Mewl for food at 4am all of a sudden cat goes crazy, for knock over christmas tree scamper soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr. Claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand pushes butt to face or hate dog, yet spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day mew meow meow. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms damn that dog . </p>
